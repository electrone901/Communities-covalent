# Communities ðŸŒ¿

Communities  is a social dApp build from the community to everyone who loves communities parks, flowers, and plants.

Communities is an NFT platform where creators and makers can sell NFTs, set up a profile, and receive tips from the community.

Whenever a viewer goes to the Communities platform will be able to check NFTs works from the different communities, see details from specific NFT and unlock exclusive content.

Overall, users will be able to:

- ask questions or answer them
- give or receive tips for answering questions
- donate money to their favorite garden community
- exchange plants and flowers


We believe that Community garden will create a more strong relationship between community gardens, neighbors, and your own green space.
